Project for CS183( Computer Vision )

Please install Python 2.7.5 first. After installation, open your terminal, type "which python". my machine returns:

<blockquote cite="http://vandadnp.wordpress.com/2012/07/05/building-and-running-python-scripts-with-xcode-4-x/">
"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python"
</blockquote>

 
If your path is different, you may need to reconfigure your XCode.

Here is some useful tutorials about OpenCV using Python language:  https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html

I created a project using XCode for all of us, so we can code under XCode.
